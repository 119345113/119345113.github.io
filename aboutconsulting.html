 <h2>Hyperautomation</h2>

 <body style="background-color:#ccffff;">
As defined by Gartner, hyper-automation “deals with the application of advanced technologies,
<br/>
including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to increasingly automate
<br/>
 processes and augment humans. Hyper-automation extends across a range of tools that can be
 <br/>
 automated, but also refers to the sophistication of the automation (i.e., discover, analyse,
<br/>
 design, automate, measure, monitor, reassess.)”
<br/>
In simple terms, hyper-automation refers to the mixture of automation technologies that exist
<br/>
 to augment and expand human capabilities.

<h2>Multiexperience</h2>
<p style="font-size:100%;">
<body style="background-color:#ccffff;">
Multiexperience is a concept pioneered by Gartner late in 2019. The concept is being championed
<br/>
as one of the biggest developments for 2020. In fact, Gartner states that “more than 25% of the
<br/>
 mobile apps, progressive web apps and conversational apps at large enterprises will be built and/or
<br/>
 run through a multiexperience development platform” by 2023.
<br/>
In short, multiexperience is about adapting to the increasing market of different devices and their
<br/>
 respective experiences. Applications now need to run on different platforms and adapt easily, all
 <br/>
 while providing a consistent experience from a business perspective.

Distributed cloud is the application of cloud computing technologies to interconnect data and applications
<br/>
 served from multiple geographic locations.
 <br/>
Distributed, in an information technology (IT) context, means that something is shared among multiple
<br/>
systems which may also be in different locations. Distributed cloud speeds communications for global
<br/>
 services and enables more responsive communications for specific regions.

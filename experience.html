<h2> Local Elction </h2>
<p style="font-size:size:100%;">
<body style="background-color:#ccffff;">
I have worked in three local elections as a poll clert as well as help lifting the voting
</br>
around count centers. Being a poll clert helped me to improve dealing with the stress
</br>
of many customers as I would have to manage the voting slips very quickly with a large
</br> 
line of people. Being a box carrier helped improve my teamwork, strength and communication
</br>
skills. I work in the elections and feel like it helps improve me as a person every year.

<h2> Catering </h2>
<p style="font-size:100%;">
<body style="background-color:#ccffff;">
I have previously worked in catering in the Keadeen hotel for two years. This involved
</br>
Bringing plates too and from tables as well as having to clean dishes the odd time.
</br>
Working here was a rewarding experience as I improved a lot with working with people
</br>
and handling difficult customers. I enjoyed working here but felt like I needed a change
</br>
so opted to leave. I also worked as a bar man for a year in the Brown Bear pub in 2019.

<h2> Customer Service <h2>
<p style="font-size:size:100%;">
<body style="background-color:#ccffff;">
I worked in Calvein Klein in Kildare Village during the summer of 2018. I worked as
</br>
a floor assistant and helped cater to the customers needs. This job was very benefitial to 
</br>
me as I am now good with handling customers
